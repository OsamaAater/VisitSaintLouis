			<p> St. Louis is one of America’s most historic cities. The city’s past, as a staging post for westward expansion, as an industrial and transportation hub,
			    and as one of the country’s musical and baseball capitals, is etched into the city’s DNA. It’s not immediately obvious to a new arrival, but sooner or later you realize that St. Louisans are imbued with the conviction that theirs is one of America’s great cities – and that’s part of the charm.
				Whatever anyone else tells you, this is not a “small” city, even if it’s no longer the hub it once was.
